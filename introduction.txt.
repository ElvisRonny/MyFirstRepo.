                                  Brief Introduction About Myself
Hi my name is Elvis Ronn, I am a motivated and detail-oriented individual with strong organizational and administrative skills. 
I am skilled with Google Workspace and the Microsoft Office Suite, and I have experience with data entry, scheduling, travel management, and general administrative support.
I enjoy working in structured environments where I can apply logical thinking and problem-solving to support teams and increase productivity

I am currently taking SE 102: Foundations of Linux and Version Control, and I am excited to undertake it as part of the ALX pathway program. This course is helping me build a strong foundation in Linux systems, command-line operations,
and version control using Git and GitHub. 
I am committed to continuous learning and eager to apply these technical skills to real-world projects while growing within the software engineering pathway.
